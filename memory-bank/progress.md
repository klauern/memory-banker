# progress.md for memory-banker

## What Works (Completed and Functional)

- **Core Package Architecture:**  
  The basic Python package structure under `memory_banker/` with core modules (`agents.py`, `cli.py`, `memory_bank.py`) is established and importable. The presence of `__init__.py` validates that it is a proper package.

- **CLI Entry Point:**  
  A command line interface script is defined (`main.py`) and exposed via a console script entry `memory-banker` in `pyproject.toml`. This indicates a working CLI launch mechanism.

- **Dependency Management:**  
  The project uses `pyproject.toml` for packaging and dependencies, specifically requiring Python 3.13+. Dependencies such as `click` (for CLI) and `openai-agents[litellm]` are pinned, supporting expected functionality like command line usage and AI agent capabilities.

- **Basic Git Setup:**  
  The project is version controlled with git on branch `main`. `.gitignore` is configured to exclude common Python artifacts and virtual environment folders.

- **Initial Documentation:**  
  `README.md` exists (though contents are not fully specified here), helpful for onboarding or reference.

## What's Left to Build

- **Feature Completion Within Modules:**  
  Content of core modules (`agents.py`, `memory_bank.py`, `cli.py`) is unknown and likely incomplete or under development. Key memory bank agent logic and CLI commands need further implementation and testing.

- **Testing Infrastructure:**  
  No test folders or test files detected. Unit and integration tests must be created for robust validation and CI integration.

- **End-to-End Functionality:**  
  The full agentic memory bank creation workflow is not verified or proven stable. Integration of `openai-agents` with custom memory bank logic requires completion.

- **Documentation and Developer Guidance:**  
  Detailed usage instructions, API documentation, developer guides, and examples are missing and should be added to improve usability and maintainability.

- **Performance and Security Audits:**  
  No information on optimization or security considerations. These remain future tasks after core functionality stabilizes.

## Current Status and Development Stage

- **Maturity Level:** Early prototype phase with foundational scaffolding in place. The project is functional at the package and CLI level but lacks tested, full feature implementation.

- **Stability:** Pre-alpha; due to uncommitted changes and incomplete documentation/tests, the project is not yet production-ready.

- **Code Health and Validation:** Unclear test coverage and code quality metrics; no continuous integration or static analysis reported.

- **Deployment Readiness:** Not ready for deployment or user release; significant development remains.

## Known Issues and Limitations

- **Incomplete Project Files:** Many changes are uncommitted in critical files (`main.py`, `memory_banker` modules, `README.md`), indicating ongoing edits and potential instability.

- **No Test Coverage Data:** Lack of testing artifacts implies risk of runtime bugs and regressions.

- **Dependency Version Constraints:** Minimum Python 3.13 (not widely used yet) may limit early adoption.

- **Unclear Error Handling and UX:** No info on how errors or edge cases are managed in the CLI or core modules.

- **Compatibility Limitations:** Unknown support across platforms or older Python versions.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- The project appears to be initial engineering iteration focused on building a memory bank system agentically using OpenAI agents. There is no indication yet of major pivots or abandoned approaches.

- The shift from ideas to the current working directory structure and pyproject-based packaging shows an early focus on standards-compliant Python module and CLI design.

- Integration of `openai-agents` with memory bank design suggests the project is evolving towards modular AI agent orchestration architectures.

- No explicit lessons learned documented yet, but the early modular approach reflects a best practice direction.

## Technical Debt and Refactoring Needs

- **Code Structure:** Initial implementation will likely require refactoring for better modularity and separation of concerns once full features are in place.

- **Dependency Updates:** Regular updates to dependencies, especially AI-related libraries, will be necessary.

- **Testing Infrastructure:** Creation of comprehensive test suites is needed to ensure code quality and confidence.

- **Documentation:** Current README and documentation need expansion and continuous maintenance as features evolve.

- **Build and Release Pipeline:** Lack of CI/CD pipelines or automation scripts for releases, which should be added.

## Success Metrics and Progress Indicators

- **Versioning:** At `0.1.0` milestone signaling initial release cycle preparation.

- **Git Activity:** Presence of uncommitted changes indicates active development following the last commit.

- **Project Structure Compliance:** Basic Python project conventions followed, signaling readiness for growth.

- **Dependency Stability:** Using well-maintained external dependencies (`click`, `openai-agents`) facilitating faster development.

- **No formal metrics or benchmarks** established yet for performance, user adoption, or code quality.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

- **High Risk of Instability:** Due to active, uncommitted work and immature test coverage.

- **Dependency Risks:** Relying on specific versions of AI frameworks may cause compatibility challenges.

- **Resource and Timeline Constraints:** Unknown, but early stage projects often face scheduling and staffing bottlenecks.

- **Mitigation Strategies:** Prioritize completing tests, stabilization of core features, and adding automated validation. Establish CI/CD pipelines early and monitor dependency updates closely.

# Summary

The `memory-banker` project is in an early prototype phase with key package scaffolding and CLI infrastructure in place. Core agentic memory bank functionality leveraging OpenAI agents is being developed but remains incomplete and unverified through testing. The project follows modern Python packaging standards and has clear direction towards modular AI agent orchestration. Critical next steps include completing core logic, building comprehensive tests, expanding documentation, and stabilizing code with CI pipelines to reduce technical risks and progress towards a production-ready release.
