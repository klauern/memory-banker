# System Patterns for memory-banker

This document analyzes and details the system architecture and technical design patterns employed in the **memory-banker** project, grounded on the project structure, configuration, and code-level organization.

## System Architecture Overview

### High-level system design and component organization
The **memory-banker** project is organized around creating *Cline-style memory banks* utilizing AI agents. The structure is minimal and modular, with a clear separation between core logic, CLI interface, and agent-based memory management.

- **Core application package:** `memory_banker/`
  - `memory_bank.py` — Core memory bank constructs and functionalities.
  - `agents.py` — Definitions and interactions with AI agents (leverages `openai-agents`).
  - `cli.py` — Command-line interface entrypoints for user interaction with the memory bank system.
- **Entry point:** `main.py` — The executable script initializing the CLI.

Supporting files:

- `pyproject.toml` — Project metadata, dependencies, scripts.
- `.gitignore` — Standard Python and environment file ignores.
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions.
- `CLAUDE.md` — Likely documentation related to the Claude AI agent (not detailed here).

### Architectural patterns and principles
- **Modular Monolith:** The system encapsulates logically distinct subsystems (memory management, agent interface, CLI) into separate modules/packages within a single deployable unit.
- **Agent-Driven Architecture:** Leverages external AI agent frameworks (`openai-agents`) abstracted behind a project-specific interface.
- **Command-Driven Control:** Users interact via CLI commands routed through the `main.py` entry point invoking services from the core modules.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Memory logic, agent logic, and CLI are cleanly separated.

### System boundaries and interfaces
- **External interfaces:**
  - CLI interface exposed to users.
  - Agent API via the `openai-agents[litellm]` dependency for language model interactions.
- **Internal interfaces:**
  - `agents.py` exposing agent interaction abstractions used by the memory bank.
  - `memory_bank.py` exposes data structures and methods to manage memory constructs.
  - `cli.py` orchestrates flows by calling into these core modules.

### Modularity and separation of concerns approach
The project modularizes by functional area/internal responsibility to ease maintainability and extensibility. This fosters independent evolution of:
- Agent integration and protocols (`agents.py`).
- Memory bank data and logic (`memory_bank.py`).
- User commands and CLI parsing (`cli.py`).

---

## Key Technical Decisions

### Critical architectural choices and rationale
- **Use of AI agent frameworks:** Selecting `openai-agents[litellm]` as a dependency abstracts interaction with LLMs, enabling focus on constructing 'memory banks' without implementing lower-level AI service calls.
- **CLI-centric design:** Targeting usability by developers and automation via CLI scripts.
- **Python 3.13+ target:** Leverages latest Python features for forward compatibility and performance.

### Technology selection decisions and trade-offs
- **Python** for rapid prototyping, rich ecosystem (agents, CLI tools).
- **Click** for robust CLI parsing and invocation (`click>=8.2.1`).
- **openai-agents litellm integration** to capitalize on advanced language models and AI agent constructs.
- **Single repository, minimal dependencies:** balances simplicity and extensibility but may limit scaling to microservices.

### Design pattern choices and implementation approaches
- **Facade pattern:** The CLI serves as a facade exposing simplified commands over complex agent-memory operations.
- **Dependency injection:** Decoupling of agent implementations and memory bank logic (presumed from modular file organization).
- **Singleton or shared instances:** Likely for shared agent or memory bank instances (based on common patterns for such agents).
- **Factory or builder patterns** for creating agent instances or memory structures (typical in AI agent integration, though full code not visible).

### Performance and scalability design decisions
- As a primarily local CLI and application, the project focuses on modularity and extensibility rather than distributed scalability.
- Scalability envisaged through modular agent backends that could be scaled independently in extensions.
- Use of caching or persistent memory banks is probable but would require more code insight.

## Component Relationships and Dependencies

### How major components interact and depend on each other
- **`cli.py` → `agents.py` + `memory_bank.py`:** The CLI invokes user commands that instantiate or manipulate agents and memory banks.
- **`agents.py` → external AI services:** Wrappers or adapters to language model agents, encapsulating network calls and API interactions.
- **`memory_bank.py` → internal data structures:** Maintains the persistent or ephemeral memory objects used by the agents.
- `main.py` is the bootstrapper, initializing CLI.

### Data flow patterns between components
- User commands → CLI parser → Command handlers call memory bank and agent interfaces → Agent calls return results → CLI outputs to user.
- Memory bank stores and retrieves memory artifacts, which agents enrich or query.
- Data passes mostly synchronously via function calls; asynchronous patterns may be present for networked agent calls (details not visible).

### Communication patterns and interfaces
- **Synchronous function calls** internal to modules.
- **API or RPC calls to AI backends** abstracted by `openai-agents` library.
- **CLI commands** as the external communication interface.

### Dependency injection and inversion of control patterns
- By separating agent instantiation in `agents.py`, injection of agent implementations into memory or CLI components is facilitated.
- Abstract interfaces around agents likely enable testing and replacement.
- CLI commands may dynamically instantiate dependencies per invocation.

## Design Patterns in Use

### Specific design patterns implemented in the codebase
- **Facade:** CLI abstracts complex agent and memory operations.
- **Adapter:** Wrapping LLM agent frameworks under a common project interface.
- **Factory:** For creating agents or memory banks (inferred).
- **Command:** CLI commands implement distinct actions on the system.
- **Singleton or Module-level state:** For persistent memory bank or agent instances.

### Custom patterns developed for this project
- **Cline-style memory banking:** Custom domain pattern encapsulating reusable memory artifacts linked and queried by AI agents.
- Possibly a **memory chunking and indexing pattern** for efficient retrieval within the `memory_bank.py`.

### Anti-patterns being avoided and why
- Avoidance of **god objects**: by modularizing CLI, agents, and memory logic cleanly.
- Avoidance of **tight coupling**: by abstracting external agent calls via `agents.py`.
- Avoidance of **monolithic codebase** with clear separation of concerns.

### Pattern consistency across the codebase
- Consistent modularization with clear module-level responsibilities.
- Uniform CLI command registration and execution pattern (presumed via Click).
- Common conventions for agent interactions and memory bank API usage.

---

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Core workflows and their implementation patterns
- **Memory bank creation and enrichment:** User creates a memory bank → adds memory chunks or entries → agents query or update memory.
- **Agent interaction:** Memory banks pass context → agents generate outputs → results stored or returned.
- **CLI command flow:** Command dispatch → invoke core functionality → return user feedback.

### Error handling and resilience patterns
- CLI commands likely wrap function calls with try-except blocks for user-friendly errors.
- API agent calls expected to have retry or timeout handling (delegated to `openai-agents`).
- Memory consistency ensured by modular boundaries and explicit function contracts.

### State management and persistence patterns
- Memory banks in `memory_bank.py` maintain state; exact persistence (in-memory vs disk or DB) not specified, presumed in-memory or serialized.
- State scoped per application lifecycle or per CLI invocation.

### Configuration and environment management
- Using `pyproject.toml` and possibly `mise.toml` for environment and tool configuration.
- `.python-version` enforces Python interpreter version.
- Environment variables likely used to configure agent API keys and endpoints (typical practice but not explicitly shown).

## Integration and Extension Points

### How external systems integrate with this project
- Via **agent adapter interfaces** connected to LLM services (OpenAI, Claude, etc).
- Via **CLI commands** which can be scripted or embedded in pipelines.
- Potential hooks or extension points for other memory source connectors or agent types.

### Plugin or extension mechanisms
- Not explicitly visible, but modular architecture and separate agent module suggest future plugins for new agent types or memory stores.
- CLI extensible through Click’s plugin command groups.

### API design patterns and conventions
- Internal APIs follow Pythonic method and class designs, encapsulated in `memory_bank` and `agents`.
- CLI commands designed with idempotency and composability.

### Backwards compatibility considerations
- Project currently in early version (0.1.0) - design likely evolving to maintain stability.
- Semantic versioning implied in `pyproject.toml`.
- Modular design allows non-breaking extension by adding new agent or memory types.

---

## Quality and Maintainability Patterns

### Code organization and structure patterns
- Functional separation by modules.
- Naming aligns with domain concepts (`memory_bank`, `agents`, `cli`).
- Entrypoint `main.py` keeps bootstrapping separate from logic.

### Testing patterns and strategies
- Not explicitly present but anticipated:
  - Unit tests for `memory_bank` and `agents`.
  - CLI command integration tests.
  - Mocking of agent APIs for deterministic tests.

### Documentation and commenting conventions
- README details project purpose and usage.
- Expected module docstrings and inline comments following Python standards (not shown in summary).
- Additional documents like `CLAUDE.md` for agent-specific info.

### Refactoring and evolution strategies
- Clear module boundaries allow safe refactoring.
- Dependency injection enables swap-out of agent backends.
- Use of pyproject.toml for dependency version pinning avoids breakages.
