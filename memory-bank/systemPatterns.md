# System Architecture and Design Patterns for Memory Banker

---

## System Architecture Overview

### High-level System Design and Component Organization

Memory Banker is a modular Python CLI application designed to generate Cline-style memory banks by analyzing developer projects using OpenAI Agents. The system is organized into clearly defined components:

- **CLI Layer (`memory_banker/cli.py` and `memory_banker/main.py`)**
  - Entry points for user interactions.
  - Parses commands and options, dispatching to appropriate business logic.

- **Agents Layer (`memory_banker/agents.py`)**
  - Contains specialized AI agent classes responsible for analyzing specific project aspects.
  - Each agent produces one of the six core memory bank documents using tailored prompts and analysis strategies.

- **Memory Bank Management (`memory_banker/memory_bank.py`)**
  - Responsible for managing file I/O of the generated memory bank files.
  - Responsible for organizing generated content on disk under `memory-bank/`.

- **Infrastructure**
  - Integration with OpenAI Agents framework (`openai-agents` package).
  - Configuration via environment variables, CLI options, and pyproject.toml.

The structure facilitates a logical separation between command handling, project analysis intelligence, and output persistence.

### Architectural Patterns and Principles Being Followed

- **Agent-based Modular Architecture**
  - Clear separation of concerns by assigning specific responsibilities to distinct AI agents.
  
- **Single Responsibility Principle**
  - Each module, class, and function has a clearly defined purpose.

- **Dependency Injection**
  - Dependencies (such as API keys, timeout settings, and model choices) are passed via CLI parameters and environment variables to decouple components.

- **Interface Segregation and Loose Coupling**
  - CLI does not depend on internal agent implementations.
  - Agents provide well-defined interfaces for analysis.
  
- **Convention over Configuration**
  - Standard file locations for memory banks.
  - Default settings like timeout and model choices are provided but can be overridden.

- **Idempotent Operations**
  - Commands like `init`, `update`, and `refresh` enable safe repeated usage with expected behavior.

### System Boundaries and Interfaces

- **User Interface Boundary:**
  - CLI commands (`memory-banker init`, `update`, `refresh`) are the primary user interaction points.

- **External Interface:**
  - OpenAI Agents (via the `openai-agents` Python package) API integration for AI interactions.
  - Reads project files and git history as input.
  - Outputs memory bank markdown files.

- **Internal API:**
  - Interfaces between CLI, agents, and memory bank manager are Python functions/classes with clear method signatures.

### Modularity and Separation of Concerns

- Each core concern—command parsing, agent logic, file management—is isolated.
- Agents encapsulate AI-specific logic, allowing easy extension and replacement.
- Memory bank file management is decoupled from CLI and agent logic.
- Testing modules (`tests/unit`, `tests/integration`) cover isolated and integrated behaviors separately.

## Key Technical Decisions

### Critical Architectural Choices and Rationale

- **Agent-based design**
  - Enables division of complex project understanding into manageable scoped roles.
  - Easier to scale and maintain.

- **Using the `openai-agents` framework**
  - Leverages an existing robust framework for AI agent orchestration.
  - Supports multiple OpenAI models and simplifies API integration.

- **Python 3.13 baseline**
  - Latest stable Python version allows usage of newer typing, pattern matching, and standard library features.
  
- **Command Line Interface with Click**
  - Chosen for user-friendly CLI parsing, validation, and automation support.

### Technology Selection Decisions and Trade-offs

- **OpenAI vs Local LLMs**
  - Primary design targets OpenAI API usage for quality and latest models.
  - `openai-agents[litellm]` dependency allows possible LiteLLM integrations for offline usage.

- **Click vs argparse**
  - Click provides simpler decorators and richer CLI features at minimal overhead.

- **File System Based Persistence**
  - Memory bank stored as markdown files in a dedicated directory (`memory-bank/`), easily inspectable.
  - No database or complex storage — simpler and portable.

- **Testing Framework**
  - pytest chosen for flexibility and community support.

### Design Pattern Choices and Implementation Approaches

- **Command Pattern**
  - CLI commands encapsulate interaction logic.

- **Factory Pattern**
  - Agents may be instantiated via a factory to isolate creation logic and facilitate extension.

- **Strategy Pattern**
  - Different agents encapsulate distinct analysis strategies.

- **Template Method**
  - Agents follow a standard lifecycle: analyze project → generate markdown content → write to file.

- **Dependency Injection**
  - Injecting OpenAI API credentials, timeout, and model parameters into agents and CLI.

### Performance and Scalability Design Decisions

- Timeouts configurable to prevent long-hanging requests.
- Asynchronous execution is currently limited but can be extended (future evolution).
- Agents designed to operate independently; potential for parallelization.
- Caching or incremental updates currently minimal; future work could add delta analysis.

## Component Relationships and Dependencies

### Major Component Interactions and Dependencies

- **CLI ↔ Agents**
  - CLI gathers user input and invokes agent analysis routines.
  
- **Agents ↔ OpenAI API (via openai-agents)**
  - Agents issue requests to OpenAI services for text generation.

- **Agents ↔ Memory Bank Manager**
  - After analysis, agent outputs are passed to memory bank manager for writing files.

- **Memory Bank Manager ↔ File System**
  - Reads/writes memory bank markdown files into `memory-bank/` directory.

### Data Flow Patterns

1. User triggers CLI command
2. CLI parses options → constructs agent instances with parameters
3. Each agent analyzes the project → calls OpenAI via openai-agents
4. Agents produce markdown content
5. Memory bank manager writes content to disk
6. CLI reports success/failure

### Communication Patterns and Interfaces

- Synchronous function calls for agent execution.
- CLI uses callbacks and exception propagation to handle failures.
- Agents encapsulate OpenAI API interactions.

### Dependency Injection and Inversion of Control Patterns

- CLI injects configuration parameters (model, timeout, api-key) into agents.
- Agent base classes accept configuration via constructor or setters.
- Memory bank writing is abstracted so agents can focus on content generation without managing I/O directly.

## Design Patterns in Use

### Specific Design Patterns Implemented

- **Agent Pattern (Custom)**
  - Specialized agent classes for each memory bank section:
    - `ProjectBriefAgent`
    - `ProductContextAgent`
    - `ActiveContextAgent`
    - `SystemPatternsAgent`
    - `TechContextAgent`
    - `ProgressAgent`

- **Factory Pattern**
  - Possibly a factory function creating agent instances based on the memory bank type.

- **Command Pattern**
  - CLI commands modeled as discrete functions mapped by Click.

- **Template Method (within agents)**
  - Standardized flow where subclasses override analysis step but inherit reading input and writing output steps.

### Custom Patterns Developed for This Project

- **Memory Bank File Manager Pattern**
  - Abstracted file management interface allowing easy switching of underlying storage or formatting.

- **Configurable Agent Runner**
  - Agents accept dynamic parameters (timeout, model) injected at runtime, allowing customization without code changes.

### Anti-patterns Being Avoided and Why

- Avoided **god functions** by modularizing logic into agents.
- Avoided **tight coupling** between CLI, agents, and I/O layers to improve testability and maintainability.
- Avoided **monolithic classes** by adhering to single responsibility.
- Avoided **hard-coded configurations** by supporting environment variables and CLI overrides.

### Pattern Consistency Across the Codebase

- Consistent use of typed function signatures and dataclasses for configuration.
- Uniform error handling and logging conventions.
- Naming conventions follow Python standards for clarity and maintainability.
- Docstrings present on public classes and functions.

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Core Workflows and Implementation Patterns

- **Initialization (`memory-banker init`):**
  - CLI initializes agent instances for all six memory bank types.
  - Each agent analyzes the project files and environment.
  - Memory bank markdown files generated and written to `memory-bank/`.

- **Update and Refresh:**
  - Similar to init, but update may selectively refresh changed content.
  - Refresh forcibly rebuilds all memory bank content.
  
- **Agent Analysis Lifecycle:**
  - Load configured parameters.
  - Analyze project files and git history.
  - Compose prompt for AI agent.
  - Submit prompt and receive response.
  - Process response into markdown content.
  - Output file write.

### Error Handling and Resilience Patterns

- Validation of user input at CLI layer (e.g., valid paths, API keys).
- Catch exceptions during OpenAI API calls; retry or fail gracefully.
- Meaningful error messages propagated to user with context.
- Use of logging to trace failure points.
- Agents validate AI output format before writing to disk.

### State Management and Persistence Patterns

- Stateless agents: each run analyzes current project state.
- Persistence is file-based markdown documents in `memory-bank/`.
- No in-memory long-term state; state is derived from project files and git.

### Configuration and Environment Management

- Configuration priority:
  1. CLI options (e.g., `--project-path`, `--model`, `--timeout`, `--api-key`)
  2. Environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)
  3. Default values embedded in code.

- Pyproject.toml and `.python-version` for development environment consistency.
- `.gitignore` excludes ephemeral files.

## Integration and Extension Points

### External System Integration

- Integrates externally with OpenAI API via `openai-agents`.
- Reads local git repository using git CLI or Python lib (implied).
- Outputs to local filesystem.

### Plugin or Extension Mechanisms

- Agent architecture designed for easy addition of new specialized agents.
- Potential extension: dynamically load agents via entry points or plugin pattern.
- Model support can be extended via parameterization.

### API Design Patterns and Conventions

- No external web API currently; internal Python APIs follow standard practices:
  - Clear function signatures with type hints.
  - Consistent exceptions on error.

### Backwards Compatibility Considerations

- Semantic versioning planned for package releases.
- Markdown memory bank file formats and locations stable with versioning notes.
- CLI interface retro-compatible with evolving flags.

---

## Quality and Maintainability Patterns

### Code Organization and Structure Patterns

- Source code under `memory_banker/` vendored as a standard Python package.
- Tests organized by scope under `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`.
- Separation of concerns aids maintainability.

### Testing Patterns and Strategies

- Unit tests cover public functions and agent logic (e.g., `tests/unit/test_agents.py`).
- Integration tests verify end-to-end CLI workflows (`tests/integration/`).
- Use of fixtures and mocks for API calls (`tests/fixtures/conftest.py`).
- Tests verify valid outputs and error handling.

### Documentation and Commenting Conventions

- Docstrings on modules, classes, and methods following PEP-257.
- README.md provides detailed user and developer guidance.
- Inline comments focus on explaining complex logic and rationale.
- Commit messages and changelogs used to track evolution.

### Refactoring and Evolution Strategies

- Regular code style enforcement with `ruff` and formatting ensures consistent style.
- Modular design reduces risk of regressions.
- Use of pyproject.toml to manage dependencies for stable environments.
- Separate tests enable confidence in safe refactoring.
- Clear separation of agent functionality facilitates addition of new capabilities.
