# Project Brief for memory-banker

## Project Overview

**memory-banker** is a Python-based tool designed to facilitate the agentic creation of Cline-style memory banks tailored for software projects. It leverages AI agent frameworks to automate the construction and management of structured knowledge repositories ("memory banks") which enhance the accessibility, maintainability, and contextual intelligence of project documentation and code artifacts.

The core purpose of memory-banker is to systematically generate and organize persistent, structured memory of a project that can be programmatically queried and extended. This enables developers and AI agents to collaborate effectively by referencing a coherent knowledge base aligned with project context and architecture.

Primary functionalities include:

- Creating and updating memory banks representing project data and knowledge.
- Providing a command-line interface (CLI) to interact with and manage memory banks.
- Utilizing AI agent abstractions (via the openai-agents package) to automate memory bank generation.
- Supporting extensions and integrations for flexible memory management aligned with Cline's methodological principles.

## Core Requirements and Goals

- **Fundamental Requirements:**
  - Must support creation, update, and persistence of memory banks for arbitrary projects.
  - Provide a user-friendly CLI for seamless interaction.
  - Integrate AI agent workflows to automate memory extraction and organization.
  - Ensure compatibility with Python 3.13+ and dependencies like `click` and `openai-agents[litellm]`.
  - Enable extensibility to accommodate evolving memory structures and project types.

- **Primary Objectives and Success Criteria:**
  - Deliver an automated and reliable process for generating Cline-style memory banks.
  - Achieve high accuracy and relevance in memory content relevant to the target project.
  - Ensure an intuitive developer experience using the CLI and API.
  - Establish robust architectural patterns that support maintainability and scalability.
  - Provide clear documentation and examples to onboard new users easily.

- **Key Constraints and Boundaries:**
  - The memory bank system focuses specifically on Cline-style memory schemas; alternative memory frameworks are out of scope.
  - It operates primarily within Python project ecosystems.
  - It depends on external AI services accessible through the `openai-agents` library.
  - Real-time or distributed multi-user synchronization features are not supported initially.
  
- **Non-Negotiable Features:**
  - Reliable CLI command structure (`memory-banker` command line tool).
  - Core modules must include memory bank abstractions, AI agent integration, and CLI interaction.
  - Consistent and semantic project versioning and Python packaging standards.
  - Effective isolation of agent logic and memory management within module design.

## Target Users and Use Cases

- **Primary User Personas:**
  - **Software Developers:** who want to embed, maintain, and query structured project knowledge.
  - **AI Researchers/Engineers:** leveraging agent frameworks to automate documentation and contextual knowledge capture.
  - **Technical Writers:** assisting in generation and upkeep of detailed project memory content.
  - **Project Maintainers:** aiming for enhanced onboarding, traceability, and knowledge-sharing within teams.

- **Key Use Cases and Workflows:**
  1. **Initial Memory Bank Creation:** User runs CLI command to generate a memory bank from an existing codebase.
  2. **Automated Updates:** Periodic or triggered regeneration of memory banks reflecting project changes.
  3. **Agent Interaction:** AI agents use memory banks to answer questions, provide insights, or assist in development.
  4. **Memory Bank Inspection:** Users query or browse memory contents via CLI or integrated tools.
  
- **User Experience Goals:**
  - Provide concise, clear CLI feedback and help documentation.
  - Minimize manual configuration steps.
  - Deliver predictable and meaningful memory bank outputs aligned with project realities.
  - Enable extensions or overrides by advanced users.

## Project Scope Definition

- **Included in Scope:**
  - Development of core memory bank data structure and persistence modules.
  - CLI tooling for creating and managing memory banks.
  - Integration of openai-agents based AI workflows to drive automation.
  - Python packaging and dependency management.
  - Documentation and example usage aligned with Cline-style memory banks.

- **Explicitly Out of Scope:**
  - GUI-based memory bank management tools.
  - Support for non-Cline memory architectures.
  - Real-time collaboration or distributed memory syncing.
  - Language support outside Python.
  - Direct AI model training or fine-tuning.

- **Success Metrics and Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Successful creation of memory banks on sample projects within a single CLI command.
  - Automated memory banks contain relevant, structured project knowledge conforming to Cline principles.
  - Dependency installation and command execution without errors in Python 3.13 environments.
  - Clear, reviewed documentation covering installation, usage, and extension points.
  - Code modularity ensuring isolated agent logic, CLI interface, and memory bank components.

## Foundational Decisions

- **Architectural and Design Principles:**
  - Modular design separating core memory logic (`memory_bank.py`) from AI agents (`agents.py`) and CLI interface (`cli.py`).
  - Use of agent-driven workflows, leveraging the `openai-agents` framework for task orchestration.
  - Principle of composability: core memory bank data structures designed for extension.
  - Minimal external dependencies besides `click` for CLI and `openai-agents` for AI agent capabilities.
  - Maintain strict semantic versioning and Python packaging conventions for clarity and compatibility.

- **Key Technology Choices and Rationale:**
  - **Python 3.13+:** Ensures access to latest language features and typing improvements.
  - **click:** Provides robust CLI command management with minimal overhead.
  - **openai-agents[litellm]:** Enables integration with AI-driven agents suitable for memory automation tasks.
  - **pyproject.toml/mise.toml:** Modern packaging and build management tools for Python ecosystems.
  
- **Important Patterns and Conventions:**
  - Use of a clear CLI entrypoint (`main.py` exposing `cli` as script).
  - Source code organized under `memory_banker` package namespace.
  - Docstrings and modular imports to clarify component responsibilities.
  - Avoidance of global state; memory bank instances managed passively or through CLI.
  - Use of semantic Python naming conventions with concise module and function names.
