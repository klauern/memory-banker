# Technical Implementation Context for memory-banker

This document captures the comprehensive technical context for the **memory-banker** project based on its current structure, configuration, and dependencies. It is designed to complement the project brief with detailed implementation specifics, setup instructions, and operational considerations.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:**
  - Python, version >= 3.13 (as specified in `pyproject.toml`)

- **Frameworks and Libraries:**
  - `click` (version >= 8.2.1) — For building the command-line interface (CLI)
  - `openai-agents[litellm]` (version >= 0.0.17) — For agentic AI memory bank creation and interaction

- **Development Tools:**
  - Poetry or Pip (for package management; `pyproject.toml` is configured for dependency and build management)
  - Git (version control)
  - Potential use of Litellm backend via OpenAI-agents dependency

- **Runtime Environments and Platforms:**
  - Works on platforms supporting Python 3.13+
  - Command line environment with POSIX shells or Windows PowerShell supported via `click`

---

## Development Setup and Environment

### Step-by-step Environment Setup

1. **Ensure Python 3.13+ is installed**

   ```bash
   python3 --version  # Must output 3.13 or newer
   ```

2. **Clone the repository (if not already)**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd memory-banker
   ```

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**

   Using the lock file (`uv.lock`) and `pyproject.toml`, install dependencies via Poetry or pip:

   - Using Poetry (recommended if Poetry is installed):

     ```bash
     poetry install
     ```

   - Using pip (if Poetry is not installed):

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt  # Generate requirements.txt with `poetry export` if needed.
     pip install .
     ```

5. **Set environment variables (if necessary)**

   - For any OpenAI API keys or environment-specific credentials, export variables such as:

     ```bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
     ```

### Configuration Requirements

- Python environment set to 3.13 or newer (documented in `.python-version` and `pyproject.toml`)
- API keys/configuration for connecting to OpenAI or any AI services might be needed; this is implied by presence of `openai-agents` dependency
- `mise.toml` is present but its purpose is unclear; likely related to project-specific tooling or configuration (needs review)

### IDE/Editor Setup and Recommended Extensions

- Recommended IDEs: VSCode, PyCharm, or other Python-supporting editors
- Suggested extensions for VSCode:
  - Python extension by Microsoft — Linting, IntelliSense, debugging
  - Pylance — Enhanced language support
  - GitLens — Git integration
  - EditorConfig — Enforce consistent coding styles if applicable

---

## Technical Constraints and Requirements

- **System Requirements:**
  - Python 3.13 or greater runtime
  - Compatible OS: Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS) and Windows
  - Network access for API calls to OpenAI agents and dependencies

- **Performance Requirements:**
  - Real-time or interactive CLI usage expected; performance depends on AI API latency
  - Local operations (memory management) to be efficient with careful resource use

- **Security Requirements:**
  - API keys and secrets must be securely stored and not hardcoded
  - Authentication for external APIs (OpenAI) must be maintained confidential
  - No sensitive data to be logged inadvertently

- **Compliance/Regulatory:**
  - Usage of OpenAI API may require compliance with their usage policies
  - No explicit compliance requirements indicated; environment-dependent

---

## Dependencies and External Integrations

- **Core Dependencies:**
  - `click`: CLI parsing and command management
  - `openai-agents[litellm]`: Core AI agent framework for memory bank functionality

- **Optional Dependencies:**
  - None explicitly listed; extras within `openai-agents[litellm]` managed

- **External Services and APIs:**
  - OpenAI API backend utilized through `openai-agents` package for agent functionalities

- **Third-Party Integrations:**
  - Litellm backend (Lightweight LLM backend) via `openai-agents`

---

## Tool Usage Patterns and Conventions

- **Build System:**
  - Python’s `pyproject.toml` based project management
  - Usage of `pip` or Poetry for dependency resolution and packaging

- **Testing Frameworks:**
  - Not explicitly defined; recommend adding pytest or unittest for test automation

- **Deployment Tools:**
  - No deployment tooling specified; assumed CLI utility deployed via pip install or local use

- **Monitoring and Debugging:**
  - Debug logs to console or custom logging inside the app (requires confirmation)
  - Use Python standard logging and debugging tools

---

## Development Workflow and Standards

- **Code Organization and File Structure:**
  ```
  memory-banker/
  ├── memory_banker/          # Main package source code
  │   ├── __init__.py
  │   ├── agents.py           # AI agent logic
  │   ├── cli.py              # CLI commands and entry points
  │   └── memory_bank.py      # Memory bank core logic
  ├── main.py                 # CLI entry point with `cli()` function
  ├── pyproject.toml          # Build and dependency management
  ├── .gitignore
  ├── README.md
  └── uv.lock                 # Dependency lock file
  ```

- **Coding Standards and Style Guidelines:**
  - Standard Python PEP8 style conventions
  - Docstrings and type hints recommended (check codebase to verify)
  - Consistent naming and modularity across agents, memory bank, and CLI

- **Version Control Patterns:**
  - Git with `main` as primary branch
  - Conventional commits recommended for clear history
  - Feature branches and pull requests for new functionality

- **Code Review & QA:**
  - Peer reviews on PRs mandatory
  - Automated tests recommended to integrate with CI pipelines

---

## Operational Context

- **Deployment Environments:**
  - Primarily CLI-based usage in developer or operations environment
  - Deploy by installing package via pip or Poetry locally or in a shared environment

- **Infrastructure and Scaling:**
  - Scaling depends mainly on API service limits and local computation
  - Lightweight CLI tool with minimal resource usage

- **Backup and Disaster Recovery:**
  - Local state or cached memory banks should be regularly backed up if implemented
  - No explicit backup policy defined; recommend safe storage of agent-generated memory

- **Maintenance & Upgrade:**
  - Increment versioning per semantic versioning in `pyproject.toml`
  - Regular dependency upgrades, especially for `openai-agents` for latest AI model features

---

## Troubleshooting and Debugging

- **Common Issues & Solutions:**
  - **Dependency errors:** Ensure environment Python version matches >=3.13; reinstall dependencies.
  - **API authentication failure:** Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` validity and export in shell session.
  - **CLI command errors:** Run `memory-banker --help` to verify usage; check for typos.
  - **Lock file conflicts:** Delete `uv.lock` and re-resolve with Poetry or pip if needed.

- **Debugging Tools and Techniques:**
  - Use `pdb` or IDE debuggers to step through `cli.py`, `agents.py`, and `memory_bank.py`.
  - Enable verbose logging in code to trace API calls and state changes.

- **Performance Profiling:**
  - Profile Python code with `cProfile` or `pyinstrument` for heavy computations if found.
  - Measure API call latencies to optimize user experience.

- **Error Handling and Logging:**
  - Use Python `logging` module for structured logs
  - Catch exceptions gracefully in CLI commands and provide user-friendly error messages
  - Possible integration with monitoring tools if scaled to server deployments

# Summary

The **memory-banker** project is a Python 3.13+ CLI utility built with `click` and the `openai-agents` AI framework to create and manage Cline-style memory banks agentically. Development uses modern Python packaging (`pyproject.toml`), and operations require careful management of API credentials and environment setup. The codebase follows standard Python development practices with modular components and lightweight dependencies, geared towards extensible AI-driven memory management in projects.

This technical context document will be updated as the project evolves and more detailed implementation and operational procedures are developed.
