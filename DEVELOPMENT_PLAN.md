## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

- **Target Coverage**: 80%+
- **Framework**: pytest
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock all external API calls
- **Test Data**: Fixtures for various project types

### Integration Testing

- **CLI Testing**: Test all commands end-to-end
- **File System Testing**: Verify correct file creation/updates
- **API Integration**: Test with real API calls (separate test suite)

### Performance Testing

- **Timeout Testing**: Verify timeout mechanisms work correctly
- **Large Project Testing**: Test with complex, large codebases
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption during analysis

### User Acceptance Testing

- **Documentation Testing**: Verify README instructions work
